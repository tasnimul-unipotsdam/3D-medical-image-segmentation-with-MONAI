# 3D-medical-image-segmentation-with-MONAI

Traditional deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch do not provide 
functions to load and preprocess 3D medical images for training.  

## MONAI
[MONAI](https://monai.io/) is an open-source framework built for deep learning-based Medical Imaging research. It is built on top of PyTorch. 
This framework provides easily usable functions for 3D medical image processing specifically for loading 3-D images, augmentation, and metrics.
