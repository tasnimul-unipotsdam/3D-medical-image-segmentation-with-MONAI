# 3D-medical-image-segmentation-with-MONAI

Traditional deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch do not provide 
functions to load and preprocess 3D medical images for training. This project is about overcoming this situation by 
leveraging an open-source project, MONAI. 
## MONAI
[MONAI](https://monai.io/) is an open-source framework built for deep learning-based Medical Imaging research. It is built on top of PyTorch. 
This framework provides easily usable functions for 3D medical image processing specifically for loading 3-D images, augmentation, and metrics.   

 # Dependencies
* [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/)
